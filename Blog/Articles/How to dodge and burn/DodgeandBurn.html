		<p> <!--paragraph 1-->
		In the world of digital photography postproduction of your photos are especially important. Fixing blemishes and the skin on your model is necessary. Imperfections can be very distracting and will take away from what you are trying to show.
		</p>

		<h3>Removing Blemishes</h3>
		<p>
			Fixing the more obvious blemishes and wrinkles should be the first thing you do. This creates a cleaner image for you to work with. An important tool that is very simple to use is the healing brush tool.
		</p>
		<p>
			1.	First, you're going to need to create a new layer by selecting the new layer icon. <img src = "new layer icon.png" alt="newlayer"><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			2.	After creating the layer select the healing brush. Right click the option and select “Healing Brush Tool” in the drop-down menu
		</p>

			3.	Make sure you have the Sample settings, “Current and Below” on the top bar.
		</p>

		<p>
			4.	From here you can work methodically through each blemish. Hold the “Alt” key and left click to sample the skin you would like to cover the blemish with. Then left click to cover the blemish.

		<h1>Dodge And Burn</h1>
	<p>
		Dodge and burn, is a technique that all high end photography studios use. This technique smooths the skin and cleans up some of the less obvious blemishes and gives your model even better skin.
	</p>
	<h3>
		Step 1: Creating Check Layers
	</h3>
	<p>
		To begin we are going to need to create check layers. We are going to take the color away from the image so we aren't distracted during dodging and burning. To do this:<br>
		1.	Select the adjustment layer icon in the menu under the layer options. <img src ="Adjustmentlayericon.png" alt = "adjustmentllayer"><br>
		2.	Select the solid color option.<br>
		<img src="solidcoloroption.png" alt="solidcolor" class = "center"><br>
		3.	A menu will pop up and select a color with 0% saturation. In this example I chose dark gray.
		<img src="colorpicker.png" alt="colorpicker" class = "center"><br>
		4.	Change the blend mode of that layer from “Normal” to “Color”<br>
		<img src="blendmode1.png" alt="blendmode1" class = "center"><br>
		<img src="blendmode2.png" alt="blendmode2" class = "center"><br>
		5.	Make a “Curves” layer by selecting the adjustment layer icon   and select curves. Adjust the curve so the imperfections in the face are more noticeable.<br>
		<img src="curves.png" alt="curve" class = "center"><br>
		<img src="curvevid.gif" alt="curvevid" class = "center"><br>
		6.	To keep the layer menu clean we are going to group the check layers we’ve just created. Hold “Ctrl” and left click the layers, next press “G” to create the group.<br>
		<img src="dodgeandburnchecklayer.png" alt="curve" class = "center"><br>		
	</p>
	<h3>
		Step 2: Creating the Dodge and Burn Layers
	</h3>
	<p>
		1.	Create a “Curves” adjustment layer like before, only this time increase the entire curve.<br>
		<img src="adjustvid.gif" alt="adjustvid" class = "center"><br>
		2.	Select the layer, hold “Ctrl” and press “I”, invert the mask layer so the effect won't show. This is your dodge layer.<br>
		3.	While your dodge layer is selected. Hold “Ctrl” and press “J” to copy the layer. Select the <img src="Adjustmentlayericon.png" alt="layericon">  icon to readjust the curve downward. This is your burn layer.<br>
		<img src="properties.png" alt="properties" class = "center"><br>
		4.	Remember to properly label layers to make it easier to work with.<br>
		<img src="labellayers.png" alt="labelayers" class = "center"><br>				
	</p><img src="labellayers.png" alt="labelayers" class = "center"><br>
	<h3>
		Step 3: The Fun Stuff
	</h3>
	<p>
		Now that you have these two mask layers it's time to get to the fun stuff. Because the dodge and burn layers are inverted you will need to paint white on the layer to have the effect show. This is done using the paintbrush tool.<br>
		1.	Select the paintbrush in the toolbar.<img src="paintbrush.png" alt="paintbrush"><br>
		2.	You will first need to set your brush to, “Soft Round and turn down the brush to 1%. This gives us better control of our brush and makes it less destructive.<br>
		<img src="softround.png" alt="softround" class = "center"><br>
		<img src="flow.png" alt="flow" class = "center"><br>
		3.	To smooth the image you will want to paint the darkest areas by brightening them up with your dodge mask layer by painting white. Paint the lightest areas with the burn layer  by painting white on the image. Go through the photo little by little touching up areas.  <br>
		<img src="paintingface.gif" alt="paintingface" class = "center"><br>
		If you ever make a mistake or would like to redo layer painting the layer over with black or holding, “Ctrl” and pressing “Z” will erase them.<br>	
	</p>

	<p>
		In photography, skin is the foundation of a beautiful image. This application has given us the tools to make anyone have flawless skin. This technique takes practice, but once you master it you can create incredible images!
